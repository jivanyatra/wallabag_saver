  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Wallabag Saver</strong> is a browser extension for saving web pages to your own Wallabag server(s). I take your privacy seriously and am committed to protecting your data.</p>

  <h2>What information do I store?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wallabag server configuration:</strong> Your Wallabag server URL, client ID, client secret, and authentication tokens (access and refresh tokens) are stored in your browser's local storage. <em>Usernames and passwords are <strong>never</strong> stored.</em></li>
    <li><strong>No user-identifying information:</strong> I do not collect, store, or transmit any information that can identify you personally.</li>
    <li><strong>No browsing history:</strong> Your browsing history or any list of URLs you visit is never stored or transmitted. URLs are only sent to your chosen Wallabag server when you explicitly use the save feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How is your data used?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All stored data is used <strong>solely</strong> for the core functionality of saving pages to your Wallabag server(s).</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens and client credentials are only sent to the Wallabag server(s) you configure, and never to any third party.</li>
    <li>No data is ever sent to me or to any analytics service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I am a staunch supporter of <strong>self-hosted applications</strong>, <strong>user privacy</strong>, and <strong>transparency</strong> in software. This extension is designed to empower you to control your own data and use your own infrastructure, without reliance on third-party services or cloud providers. I believe your data should remain yours, and you should always know exactly what your software is doing.
  </p>
